1.Skin Disease Classification using CNN

This project focuses on building and comparing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to automatically classify skin disease images. It was developed using Jupyter Notebook with Anaconda and VS Code on a local machine.

---
2.Objective
To design and evaluate multiple CNN models (Manual CNN, AlexNet, LeNet) for identifying various skin conditions from medical images, and analyze which performs best in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

3.Technologies & Tools
Python 3.x  
Jupyter Notebook (Anaconda)  
Keras & TensorFlow  
NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
VS Code  

---

4.Project Files
M1_manual.ipynb – Custom-built CNN model from scratch  
M2_alexnet.ipynb – Implementation of the AlexNet architecture  
M3_lenet.ipynb – Implementation of LeNet model for comparison  
requirements.txt – Lists all dependencies used  

---

5.Results (Based on Current Training Runs)
| Model        | Approximate Accuracy Achieved (Validation) |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Manual CNN   | ~8% (Needs improvement)                    |
| AlexNet      | ~45% (Needs improvement)                   |
| LeNet        | ~93% (Best performance)                    |

*Note: Manual CNN and AlexNet models currently underperform compared to LeNet, indicating potential areas for tuning or redesign.*



6.How to Run This Project

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.  
2. Install dependencies using:  

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Launch Jupyter Notebook via Anaconda or by running:

jupyter notebook


4. Open and run the .ipynb files step-by-step in the following order:

   * M1_manual.ipynb
   * M2_alexnet.ipynb
